R3SEI59NALCYH7,Mohit,"Warning: My review is purely my opinion. I'll list out the issues I faced with this one so that you are well informed before purchasing this non-returnable product.It's a really good earphone (on paper).2 stars for making it feature loaded.1. Dual pairing (this is better than quickswitch, as you stay connected to 2 devices at the same time)2. Great battery life3. Touch controls (first in this range)4. Incoming call vibrationSounds like a complete package?Well, here's what I faced that made this device feel useless:1. Bad sound quality (people will say that audio could be subjective. But I am certain that for music, these sound bad. If you really don't care about that, well, check the next point).2. The earbuds, as fancy and premium they look in the photos, are painful to put on in real life. Half an hour of usage and I found myself throwing them away. The buds were too large, and the rubber hook, too hard. Contrastingly, I own a Realme Buds Wireless (2 years old now), and I couldn't even feel I'm wearing it for long times.3. The touch button is a gimmick. Sometimes, it works. Sometimes it doesn't.Overall, they got the spirit right. On paper they are offering pretty good features. But some cost cutting and lack of comfort research left me wanting for more, and hey, if the earphones SOUND BAD and HURT YOUR EAR, what good are the other fancy features worth?",Reviewed in India on 25 May 2021,"They got the spirit right, but somewhere, the implementation went wrong",1,,394,Carbon Black,Flair

Touch sensor also works fine.PROBLEM ARISES HERE :- At too low volume the neckband sound is very high, which is hurting my ears. The lowest volume is also too loud. Did a lot of settings in my phone but no solution at all.I tried it in SAMSUNG M21 & OPPO A54 (same problem of loud volume exist while connecting neckband to these two devices)In REDMI NOTE 6 PRO - the volume is manageable, not too loud at low volume.Edit(19/01/2022):- i found a way to decrease the loudness, i did equaliser setting in phone and make the equaliser at its lowest decibel and it worked, now no issues with this neckband.

RJATIE2GV04SC,Abhishek Kumar Jha,"Don't just go for touch gimmick, awful product. Build is ok ok but not very good. Band quality feels like plastic on neck and becomes uncomfortable many a times. Sound is too loud at first bar also which is not good for ears and also if you want to listen in low volume. Talking about call vibration alert, it may irritate you since if you put the call on silence it will still keep vibrating at great pace. Battery is good.Mic quality is worst, if you are even under a fan, the other party would hear the fan more than you.I had replaced my first order thinking that there is some issue with mic, but the replacement was a used product with teared box and with micro usb cable, which the band doesn't support.Please go for any other band, even the boat 335 may cost you cheaper and is better than flair neckband in every aspect.Hit like if you could relate to it.",Reviewed in India on 17 June 2021,Awful product!!,1,,61,Carbon Black,Flair

R1YQIYHGVNQHP9,Karan,"The Noise Flair features in-ear type earbuds, which come with silicone covers to ensure a snug fit. The earbuds have magnets on both ends, so whenever you hang them around your neck, they will get stuck to each other. Now, this is common in almost every neckband you will come across, what is unique about the Noise Flair is that it does not come with physical buttons. Meaning, there is no power button to turn on and off the device, you can connect the device to your phone simply by separating the earbuds and then it will be turned off when you stick back the earbuds. has launched a new neckband in the market called the Noise Flair. While the TWS earbuds market is full of choices, the neckband segment is slowly picking up pace. Brands like Realme, OnePlus, Xiaomi and even Boat had launched a couple of neckbands in the past, but Flair is the first for Noise. The neckband features a great design and comes with many firsts.Neckbands seem far more comfortable and reliable. At least you don‚Äôt live with the fear of losing them, and they don‚Äôt keep falling off from your ear, but there is a certain section of people that want to stay from anything that has wires. Well, if you detest wires of any kind, you would probably not like the Flair, too, but if you are someone like me, who fears losing the TWS earbuds every time I step out, the neckband is the right pick for you. At Rs 1799, Noise Flair comes with a design to die for, touch controls‚Äî which is a first on a neckband, along with excellent battery life. So, should you consider the Noise Flair? Let us find out in the review.Noise Flair: DesignFrom the time I was handed over the box of Noise Flair neckband, I was quite in love with its design. I have come across many neckbands in the past, but none seemed as chic and premium as this one. The brands don‚Äôt seem to pay much heed to the design of the neckbands because all tend to look the same but let me tell you, and Noise has worked on Flair‚Äôs design. A great combination of colours has also added to the beauty of the neckband. There are six colour options available, and I received the grey and gold colour for review, and it looks great.This is both new and a little disappointing at times. While there is no hassle of turning on and off the button when you are done listening to music, you may sometimes forget to stick back the earbuds. And when you do this, the device remains switched on, leading to battery loss. Sometimes the earbuds get disconnected on their own if it is casually thrown around. So yes, while I appreciate the newness Noise has added to the Flair, I wish an additional small button could have been added to switch off the device.Moving on, the neckband is made up of high-quality silicone, which is meant to provide a comfortable fit. Even when I had worn the neckband for hours, I didn‚Äôt feel the weight around my neck, nor did my skin feel itchy. So, Noise has used clearly good quality products.

R32ZOIV3FPYRPQ,ishriit tibdewal,the overall product is good with a big battery life and nice audio but the one thing that ruins this product for me is the touch controls. they sometimes automatically pause or play my videos and start my google assistant as they are very sensitive and very responsive. the other problem I faced was that sometimes when I disconnect the buds the device still doesnt power on... for that I have to connect them and disconnect again for the device to turn on.the earphones do hurt after long hours of continuous wearing...
