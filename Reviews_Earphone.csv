"Warning: My review is purely my opinion. I'll list out the issues I faced with this one so that you are well informed before purchasing this non-returnable product.It's a really good earphone (on paper).2 stars for making it feature loaded.1. Dual pairing (this is better than quickswitch, as you stay connected to 2 devices at the same time)2. Great battery life3. Touch controls (first in this range)4. Incoming call vibrationSounds like a complete package?Well, here's what I faced that made this device feel useless:1. Bad sound quality (people will say that audio could be subjective. But I am certain that for music, these sound bad. If you really don't care about that, well, check the next point).2. The earbuds, as fancy and premium they look in the photos, are painful to put on in real life. Half an hour of usage and I found myself throwing them away. The buds were too large, and the rubber hook, too hard. Contrastingly, I own a Realme Buds Wireless (2 years old now), and I couldn't even feel I'm wearing it for long times.3. The touch button is a gimmick. Sometimes, it works. Sometimes it doesn't.Overall, they got the spirit right. On paper they are offering pretty good features. But some cost cutting and lack of comfort research left me wanting for more, and hey, if the earphones SOUND BAD and HURT YOUR EAR, what good are the other fancy features worth?","They got the spirit right, but somewhere, the implementation went wrong",1
I loved the product in every term .... design....built.... quality.... sound.... battery.....i do suggest everyone to go with this with thinking another 💫,Fully satisfied ☺️,5
"Good performance  noise  I ithink these is  trending better than OnePlus ,🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍 sprrrrrrrrrr plus point touch control clear phone call song bass achha  and 8min 8hrs",Sprr,5
"Call quality and connectivity is good. Bass and sound quality is also very good. Touch sensor also works fine.PROBLEM ARISES HERE :- At too low volume the neckband sound is very high, which is hurting my ears. The lowest volume is also too loud. Did a lot of settings in my phone but no solution at all.I tried it in SAMSUNG M21 & OPPO A54 (same problem of loud volume exist while connecting neckband to these two devices)In REDMI NOTE 6 PRO - the volume is manageable, not too loud at low volume.Edit(19/01/2022):- i found a way to decrease the loudness, i did equaliser setting in phone and make the equaliser at its lowest decibel and it worked, now no issues with this neckband. Also battery performance is upto the mark.Press the helpful button if my review somehow helped you.",Must read before buying,3
"Don't just go for touch gimmick, awful product. Build is ok ok but not very good. Band quality feels like plastic on neck and becomes uncomfortable many a times. Sound is too loud at first bar also which is not good for ears and also if you want to listen in low volume. Talking about call vibration alert, it may irritate you since if you put the call on silence it will still keep vibrating at great pace. Battery is good.Mic quality is worst, if you are even under a fan, the other party would hear the fan more than you.I had replaced my first order thinking that there is some issue with mic, but the replacement was a used product with teared box and with micro usb cable, which the band doesn't support.Please go for any other band, even the boat 335 may cost you cheaper and is better than flair neckband in every aspect.Hit like if you could relate to it.",Awful product!!,1
"Very disappointed with the product as it has a very poor sound quality when you are on a call, you always have to struggle for the caller voice.3star just for the C-type cable and it's length.",Poor Call quality,3
Mera first order Product defect and return product then new order kiya or us ko 7 din se iss kar raha hu bhut hi badiya product hai Velu for moneyAfter 1 months use productNot good for calling kisi se bhi baat karo samne bale pe awaj bhut kaam jati hai is liye muje y product jama nai calling ki waje se,Best product & Sound,1
Bekar product waste isse acha 500 ka local wale ka sound hai and youtoube par b sab paid promotion hai . Not providing bass with 10 mm driver boat product is better than this.custmercare service is also very poor  and if you wear shirts co collar tees u have to face trouble with its touch such a waste 1800rs waste hogaya dnt purchase it,Defective product custmer care is not responding.,1
"I m writing the review after 1 week of usageSound quality is awesome, if you're not bass lover. You can hear every bits. Battery life is not promising but it goes upto 30 hrs. Its has touch controls, which is one of its kind, you can manage your music, calls and also voice assistance. The only area its lack of volume control, there is no option for volume control, you have to manage your volume with your phone. If you ignore this point it is awesome.",Noise flair neckband review after 1 week usage,4
 My product got defective with in 2 month after purchase. After so many  days  follow up  no response from them. Plz do not purchase from noise. They will give u a headache. From both earpiece are not working. @ noise plz don’t sell product when you can’t control your support team if got defective by any customer.They replace with in 1week after my complaints. From now it’s working good.,Good product but support is worst,4
This product at this price range is awesome but still i am giving 2 stars because when it launched i have order this packaging is awesome booklet design and now i have ordered again same for my brother and packaging is in one cardboard box only and amazon delivery guy behavior is worst so i am giving 2 star to this product,Kindly not change packaging and give same as before,2
 This product is really amazing we love the product it's very easy to use and very much fancy it sound quality is very good amazing sound quality and even the product looks very fancy and very nice to use the touch quality that they have given in this is really amazing will love the product thank you so much noise and Amazon both.,Sound quality 🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍,5
"If you gonna buy for the packaging experience that you see in reviews on YouTube, don't, the packaging is not nearly good as you see, and I hate when companies be deceptive like this so was initially going to give one star.But thought of using the product before writing a review, and it's actually good, battery is great, call quality is great, build quality is also good, the magnetic strength is pathetic.Touch button has lesser accidental clicks than I thought, but I don't see the point in giving touch button and not volume button separately.Could have been better",Almost disappointing,4
Sound quality poor.. 1 hour review..,Poor sound quality... Dislike 😤,1
sound quality is balanced mids and vocals are crystal clear and bass is also balanced not low bass best under the price range overall this product is good for calls and music lowers,better than oneplus bass edition,5
" I received the product on 12th February and the product was installed on 14th Feb. There were some charging issues initially as battery would drain out within few (5-6hrs) of average usage like answering phone calls etc.However, on Feb 23rd post the battery drained out completely, I chaged it for 1-1.5hr and post that the deavice is completely dead!!!There is no way I can get the device switched on!This device has 1 year warranty and i have already registered it. I need this replaced!!@noise - very dissatisfied with the Product...",Product Dead within a week!!!,1
"product is nice, well build, battery backup is very good bt not as told by brand which is 35 hrs. it roughly gives 23-24 hr backup. i m using 5wt adapter and inbox cable so no heating issue. sound quality is best under this price range. (bt bass is little muddy according to me not that thumpy) bt sound is very loud. can't use it over 75% sound. I ordered 3 noise flair neckbands. 1 out 3 have some issue over folded plastic near the edge(swollen up) . except this i have no issue. love noise products, used almost all of them. well done. keep it up. 👍🏻",noise is better then boat always.. 😂,5
EXCELLENT go for it nice sound nice design nice buds superb light weight wow gohead...👍,Excellent noise flair thanks amazon,5

"Ordered but Amazon delivered something else. Got replacement but... (Read below)Though it comes fully charged but in package it is mentioned “Use only after charging”. So, I Started using it after charging to 100 percent.The bass was great.Noise cancellation is upto the mark. (As expected)Build quality is awesome. It fits perfectly in ear.Touch controls are very smooth and handy.Trust me you'll not need any buttons to change volume. (Use Google assistant)Go for it. ❤️",Make some noise,4
Con1) The device gets switched off if not in active usage will have power up and  re connect to use2) very big latency in video playback3) when you are in a call the sound keeps getting cut4) In call other party won't hear your voice clearPro1) can connect 2 divice simultaneous2) good build3) Good fit in your ear,Not worth it,1
Have been using it for 3 weeks charges within 35 minutes on a 15w charger and it lasts for 3 days easily with phones without Dolby Atmos and for a WEEK for Phones with Dolby Atmos (it gets pretty loud with 20% volume itself) the sound quality is very good and there's no lag while playing BGMI and COD and music quality is really good and bass is okay..And built quality is very good.And the main highlight is the touch sensitive controls...Which no one offers in this price range..If you want a good looking earphones at this price range you can go for this one definitely recommending it for everyone.,One of the best Bluetooth earphones!,5
"Quality and sound is best touch control ,👌look best👌",Ab tak best neckband hai noise 😊👌👌👌👌💯,5
"Pros:1. Awesome battery life2. Super lightweight.3. Call vibration.Cons:1. Either You have to stick the earpiece together or wear them in ear .. other wise the neckband will fall off as its ultra lightweight.2. Dual pairing actually sucks . If you pair it do another device . You'll face crazy ass delay in audio on both the devices.3. It's made up of cheap plastic material not silicon.4. It doesn't support fast charging. You'll have to have charger >=15 watts. Or use power bank.5. The sound is just loud not crisp.6. connectivity range is small , You cant across the room without carrying the phone with you .There are other better  options available at this price point.",buy this one if you really don't have an option,2
"3 start only for the build quality and 2 device pairing, the sound quality is good but not best the voice is crisp but not so loud base, the main drawback is passive touch system, this is ordinary touch not fingerprint recognised touch it means you will frustrate using this because it Play pause everytime mostly, I supposed to use this in gym but you cannot able to use it because the touch sensor is so sensitive means on every rap of bichaps it stop playing. Overall good product of they use fingerprint sensor and improve bass",The touch sensor is frustrating,3
"After 1 months usage I am writing this review.Pro:Quick charging just 40 mins.Good Sound quality and voice quality.Good noise cancelationLight weightEasy to use1 click swift switching ( in case of dual connectivity)Connectivity is good and quickly connects.Vibration alert is also good.Touch control is also good.Battery life is also good I don't know whether it is actually 35 hrs as I have not checked it, but normally after an usage of 14-15hrs daily mostly calls I tend to recharge it after 7 days.Sleek designCons:App should have been there to control or configure/ reset the device.Build quality is good but could have been better as plastic is used instead of metal.No other cons as of now.Overall its a good package, I love it as it has all the features which I ever wanted.I am satisfied with the product.",Decent Product by Noise.,4
"That product is just a gimmick, amazon should unlist it right now!!--> Rs.500 neckband sounds better then it--> No volume control--> Not sync with laptop volume control--> 1 touch button is its total ISP, it's worthless--> No music enjoy, it sounds feel quite sharp on ears all the time--> Heavy Buds.--> Not returnable, not refundable only replaceable.--> Zero rating from me, if amazon allows me to do that.--> All my user experiece went bad with this neckband and after 3 days its stop working.--> I wish to place a refund request but amazon allows only replacement.--> Replacement is still packed, I want my refund. Not going to use it again .--> Want my money back .",Total Garbage!!,1
"Sound quality is good better then boat, battery life is amazing you can easily use it for 2-3 day in a single charge but i found some issue on sensor sometimes it work sometimes not and when you are in one call and there is another incoming call on you phone so you can't able to recive it and there is some sensor issue.",Sound is balanced lovely sound but their is some sensor issue,3
"The volume levels are very bad. The range between two volume levels is too much. And when connected to laptops, there's just no way you can listen to anything at lower volumes, its too loud at volume level 1. And then it just goes blasting your ears.And the customer support is very poor. When a complaint is raised, there's just no communication apart from the automated replies that I got.But a major plus point would be the battery. It lasts a veryyyy long time with a single charge, lasts for 4-5 days.",Very bad volume control,1
" I m not a music enthusiast but i love the ease to use it.Pros:Easy to connectEasy and light weight to carryGood material qualityGood sound quality, okish noise cancellationType C charging portComfortable in earsCons:Not so good touch controlsSometimes little difficult to connectBattery doesnt last even a day, hardly 1.5 to 2 hrs","Superb, love it",4
"After using product for 3 months below is the reviewProsFast chargingBattery back upFast connect to previously connected deviceConsOverall weight slightly on higher sideOkayish noise cancellingIf you are in cozy position then high chances of triggering touch controlOverall i would say bang for buck, if you are looking for a neckband with fast charging, great battery backup & overall good sound go for this product. I have personally tried multiple products in this price range of all competitor brands but this one was best out of all of them.",Great product at this price,5
"I use a Bose AE Soundlink Headphones (for music & movies), AirPods (for voice calls and phone connect) and needed one that did a good job for meetings. This product really surprised me - for its features, for its functionality and for its quality. And within a week, I had to gift 2 of my colleagues, chose this almost spontaneously. So have bought 3 so far! So, why have I not rated them 5? The Sound quality can be a lot better - there's a very slight muffle that comes across. The touch controls are super sensitive - not designed for real use, so sensitive that even when I just adjust my collar or brush my cheeks, music starts playing, or call gets cut. The need to get that perfect, and I won't hesitate to rate them 5. Battery life is excellent, charging is nice and fast and its a great product, easily good to be priced higher!",Lovely product,4
"Got this for 1299 in great Indian sale.Product worked fine at the start. I may have used it for 4-5 hours within 15 days. Then suddenly the product stopped charging. I tried different chargers, different cables, still it is not charging.Service center people also confirmed about the product bug and manufacturing defect.The service center was giving on spot replacement for realme, 8-9 days replacement for boat products but the replacement product will be delivered at our address.But for noise, they took the earphones, gave me a slip and informed me that after 8-10 days when the company sends them the replacement, they will call me and I'll again have to travel 12 kms to collect the replaced earphones.",Worst earphones. Not working within 15 days of purchase,1
Item is working very well. its battery life is good not as company claim 35 hours in one full charge but good to use. Touch control is working nicely. Only one thing I miss that volume control in this item other wise product is so good to use. I m satisfy with this noise flair.,MUST BUY,5
"Reviewing after nearly a month of use.Like -Good balanced sound qualityLook good & premiumPerfect & steady fit in ears, doesn't looseEnough playtime - nearly 30-35 hrs as claimedFast charging - less than hourMIC quality is also goodCall vibration alert - best featureLatency - good oneSoft touch control.Dislike -No volume control, have to depend on mobile volume controlNeed to improve on noise cancellationTouch control - feather touch, other object touch like shirt collar also worksThe ear piece magnet quality needs improvement as it gets separated easily, thus turns on unnecessarily.Overall a good product at the price.  It should have been manufactured in India instead of China.Thanks.Review after 10 months of use....Suddenly the headset start getting disconnect from mobile bluetooth, had to reconnect again n again.  Complain online to Noise through their website.  They home picked the faulty device n replaced with another one nearly after 15-20 days since it was within warranty.  It doesn't look like a brand new headset but close to it.Now after using the new one for about a month, sometimes the volume lowers down; then I have to unpaid n repair again & it works fine.Apart from such bugs rest is ok.Thanks.",Very Good product,4
"The Product make is faulty, had 3 replacements done for this...waited to order the product but when received1. The right ear bud was cracking sound like in a faulty speaker2. Was completely dead on day2 after hardly any use3. Third replacement had left ear cracking soundExtremely disappointed when was eagerly looking forward to use this product....its a complete waste...",Faulty Make in 3 replacements,1

With good amount of year wax in buds,😱🤮Good thingsGood functionGood battery 🔋8 min 7 to 8 hrs.Good for callGood for GamingOk ok built qualityOk ok sound qualityBad thingsCable needs to be strongVolume up down is not available (have to tell mobile by long press to up or down volume).Sound base thumping is missing.Do not compare with JBL or SONY for sound.Baki sab acha hai 😉",Not so good Not so bad,4
" It's a quality product but i don't feel it worthy, just before this i used another brand (like boat, etc etc) those are far more better than this actually its look, consistency, battery is better compared to other brands and noise cancellation is best thing in this but sound quality is not good to other brands. So i will not preferred anyone to buy this but in earphones sound quality is important to me. So i will buy any other brands which will be cheaper than this and provide a good sound quality. So if you want better sound quality then don't go for it. Thank you🥰",It's a good product but not worthy at all,4
"Just used for 3 days and giving review... Battery backup is good, Sound is also good and loud.... Its good for music.... But for calls not comfortable and not loud also very difficult to use in outside traffic.... Also after few minutes ears start etching or due to bulky design of ear buds start paining..... Not comfortable for calling as per my experience... For music sound is superb.......................... Updates after one month use it goes dead.... Stopped working no charging and no led blinks.... Total dead automatically.... Now have to register complain at noise portal and they have arranged for pick up my neckband through bluedart... But don't know what they will do repair or replace... God knows... Had same kind of experience with boult company they just send me back some other repaired product.... From 4 stars degrading to 2 for my mistake for ordering this product.....",Ok.. Ok.. product...,2
The product at this price is really worth. Very faster connectivity while connecting through bluetooth. Touch is working perfectly. Worth the money. The material of neckband is also skin friendly.Sound quality - It is very good at even lower volume the noise cancellation (cancels the environmental sound while listening to music or calls) is perfectly working.Battery life - long lasting one,"Must buy, the best!",5
" Absolutely the worst neckbands i've used till date. The specifications given by the brand looks good but only the battery life sums up to my expectations.The minimum volume on my device sounds like this on the neckband ( watch the video i've attached).This neckband Triggers headache within 30 minutes of listening.Sound is too loud and irritating bass is moderate noise cancellation is good. Battery life is good , one full charge goes one and a half day ( as per your usage).But what's good if the neckband has sound problems?!Go for the one plus bullets neckband range they provide absolute good features and has a good sound and battery range.","SOUND TOO LOUD , HURTS YOUR EAR",1

Good Features:1. Quick connectivity2. No need to press any button for on/off3. Battery life is awesome which gives me full day calls and video access without rechargingAverage in:1.

May be I received defective product., worst Bluetooth experienced ever. It has software issue I guess(gets enough load voice for beep ring and voice call but music volume lowers automatically after few days use) bought 2 models in gap of 12-13 days and both had same issue.

But in this price range it's ok. The only thing I didn't liked is noice cancellation feature. During calls the other side environment noice disturbs the voice.

It stoped charging and no physical buttons either to give it a try . I am confused what to do .Expected it to be a good product.

While laying in a bed and watching vedios, vedios getting Pause sometimes. Before I am using Noise Tune Charge. Compare to that Less weight and flawless design. Call vibrator alert is good while we are riding.After using this for a month now. Utterly disappointed now. Tune charge is far far better than this. Touch sensors are useless all the time.

They did set up a pick up of the product through Delhivery service, but have not yet given me a replacement of the product. The support ticket has no updates as well and no way to contact these guys via a call or IVR.Really a bad experience here.If you have the budget to buy these earphones then please don't. Use that money and get JBL, infinity, Sony, oneplus or even for that Matter Oppo.The above brands are way better.","If you have a budget to buy this, then rather go for JBL's or Sony's of the world.",1
"Battery Backup- UnbeatableCharging- Super fastConvenience- 1000/100 : unmatched to any other earphones I have ever usedLatency- 100 ms: These are NOT gaming earphones so nothing more should be expected. For gaming, their NeoShots 2 are just bang on!Built quality- Perfect!Touch controls- 99/100: I am a clumsy one so sometimes I mistakenly use the touch Id without knowing. However, the features and convenience is immaculate for a pioneer product in India.Pairing- 2 devices at a time, and super fast.Purpose- Perfect for anyone except gamers.Worth every buck.Overall, Kudos to Go Noise for this outstanding product. Totally love these, I don't even use my Apple airpods- that's the value the Noise Flair has had for me.",The best earphones ever! Worth every buck!,5
1) As per product promotions they have advertised that the Noise Flair will automattically detect BT device (in my case my Android Cellphone). But I have to always manually go to BT settings in my phone and select Noise product to connect; it never connects automatically.2) The sound is too too loud. Even at the least level of vol. (which is too high) I cannot further decrease bcos then it goes in mute status.3) The noise flair does not switch off even when the ear buds are connected together as advertised. I have to leave them as it is as a result the battery drains off.,Avoid buying.....only look trendy but not true as advertised,1
Comfort wise this is the best. No matter how long you keep it in your ears you will nvr notice its there. Battery backup is seriously good. But ppl could not hear clearly while riding bike with helmet. Touch has visible latency when it comes to changing the songs. Lack of volume controls is a clear drawback. Touch cannot differentiate between fingers and my shirt cloth or collar. so it messes up with the music play.,Good for music but I don't recommend it,3
"Got one for myself. Showed it to my brother, and he wanted one too. So, I ordered the same for him. Absolute pleasure! Great sound and instant, stable connectivity using Bluetooth. Indeed, this gives a great playback and talk time after just a short time of charging. The range is also really good. Definitely recommend the Noise Flair.",How good is this!,5

The call vibration is descent.. and for those people who says that it is not working with youtube...

It got unpaired after sometime of idleness and then did not connect after that automatically.",Decent neckband,3
I have ordered this product particularly for attending my office calls during WFH. I spend almost entire day on attending these calls. This product works seemlessly all through. Sometimes goes beyond multiple days with single charge. Very reliable product even during travel & driving.Don't have to think twice & you would not regret. Thanks much for such product. Keep up the good work.,Excellent product. You can go for it eyes closed.,5
Bought it early in oct 2021 and it has stopped working. I even bought one july and its life was also just for 3 months. Why are they not working properly. I m very disappointed with the product. Such a defected product. Not going to buy it again,defected product,1
"The left ear started producing distorted audio output not even a month into the purchase. The first time I attempted a warranty claim, the product was taken to the warehouse and then sent back to me UNREPAIRED & UNREPLACED. The second time I attempted a warranty claim, I had as usual sent in the neckband, charging chord and all other accessories that the original product came with.What was sent back to me was the neckband hanging out from an open box with a broken seal sticker that was completely tattered, no charging chord, and no accessories. The most ridiculous part of this entire ordeal is that despite dropping in multiple requests to be connected with a customer service executive, all I kept getting were not responses.All in all, a 0/10 for this brand. Would never recommend anyone to get a noise appliance ever again.",Only buy if you're ready for a terrible customer experience after getting a faulty product,1

"Noise is one of the most promising brands that have created a goodwill for themselves by giving such good after sales service. A satisfied customer of noise, I love everything about the products they have launched. Bluetooth headset being one of the many purchases made,I was sure of one thing and that was sound clarity and an added feature of noise cancellation is like a cherry on the cake. Love the playback duration and the band is so light,its name befits the description. Happy with the purchase.",Game changer,5
"The Noise Flair features in-ear type earbuds, which come with silicone covers to ensure a snug fit. The earbuds have magnets on both ends, so whenever you hang them around your neck, they will get stuck to each other. Now, this is common in almost every neckband you will come across, what is unique about the Noise Flair is that it does not come with physical buttons. Meaning, there is no power button to turn on and off the device, you can connect the device to your phone simply by separating the earbuds and then it will be turned off when you stick back the earbuds. has launched a new neckband in the market called the Noise Flair. While the TWS earbuds market is full of choices, the neckband segment is slowly picking up pace. Brands like Realme, OnePlus, Xiaomi and even Boat had launched a couple of neckbands in the past, but Flair is the first for Noise. The neckband features a great design and comes with many firsts.Neckbands seem far more comfortable and reliable. At least you don’t live with the fear of losing them, and they don’t keep falling off from your ear, but there is a certain section of people that want to stay from anything that has wires. Well, if you detest wires of any kind, you would probably not like the Flair, too, but if you are someone like me, who fears losing the TWS earbuds every time I step out, the neckband is the right pick for you. At Rs 1799, Noise Flair comes with a design to die for, touch controls— which is a first on a neckband, along with excellent battery life. So, should you consider the Noise Flair? Let us find out in the review.Noise Flair: DesignFrom the time I was handed over the box of Noise Flair neckband, I was quite in love with its design. I have come across many neckbands in the past, but none seemed as chic and premium as this one. The brands don’t seem to pay much heed to the design of the neckbands because all tend to look the same but let me tell you, and Noise has worked on Flair’s design. A great combination of colours has also added to the beauty of the neckband. There are six colour options available, and I received the grey and gold colour for review, and it looks great.This is both new and a little disappointing at times. While there is no hassle of turning on and off the button when you are done listening to music, you may sometimes forget to stick back the earbuds. And when you do this, the device remains switched on, leading to battery loss. Sometimes the earbuds get disconnected on their own if it is casually thrown around. So yes, while I appreciate the newness Noise has added to the Flair, I wish an additional small button could have been added to switch off the device.Moving on, the neckband is made up of high-quality silicone, which is meant to provide a comfortable fit. Even when I had worn the neckband for hours, I didn’t feel the weight around my neck, nor did my skin feel itchy. So, Noise has used clearly good quality products. By",Noise Flair neckband,5
the overall product is good with a big battery life and nice audio but the one thing that ruins this product for me is the touch controls. they sometimes automatically pause or play my videos and start my google assistant as they are very sensitive and very responsive. the other problem I faced was that sometimes when I disconnect the buds the device still doesnt power on... for that I have to connect them and disconnect again for the device to turn on.the earphones do hurt after long hours of continuous wearing... I am talking 5-6+ hours.The product overall is very good and it is a value for money product with some faults that sometimes happen.,overall a good product but with some major flaws,3
"Looks is features is ok on paper but function is not working properly. Better to add some money and go for oneplus or realme. Noise deserves under 1000 segment, it is not for premium user. It is ok for call receiving (but voice is cracking after 2 days & there is no option for refund) but not for music lover.",Not value for money,1
READ BEFORE PURCHASING ANY NECKBAND....Noise flair are only best for call purposes..If you want a nice bass and sounding neckband...Go ahead and buy a TWS...Don't worry they won't fall off your ear...Or compromise with the call quality and buy the realme neckband....Secondly...Neckbands are supposed for call qualities and not for that proper drum bass sound...If you want to listen songs while riding ...Go for TWS...BUT if you're a call guy..These are best for you,JUST FOR CALLS ⚠️⚠️,3
Bad sound quality no returns as if married and no outside support hav to live with this till it die...Bad Luck! Don't ever buy this stopped working one side ear plug soon after 15 days.. no return nor exchange available.. very bad product..Don't waste ur money ...,Bad sound quality,1
"It seems the noise sense headphones delivered are faulty or duplicate. The mic doesn't work at all. Didn't realize it till after a month of use, since I was not taking calls over the headphones. DUPED!",Faulty piece beware,1
Name Itself (NOISE) Defines The Quality..PROS :Battery Life -👌👌👌👌👌Charging Time - 👌👌👌👌CONS :1 - Vibration Mode.. Very Very Embracing Vibration Feel Which You Can't Avoid Until You Attend The Call.. Moreover There Is No Way To Turn Off The Vibration Alert Option..2 - Call Quality Not Up to The Mark.. Receiver Could Not Get Our Voice Properly Because Of The Mike Quality3 - Material Quality Not Good As Per My View.. When We Wear The Headset On Above The Shirt Its Skidding From The Shirt.. No Grip..,Disappointed 😑😑😑,2

Pl.refund my amount as soon as possible",No any volume control panel on device,1
Touch sensitive button is nothing more than a stupid gimmick. Not working properly. The magnet of the earphones r not properly. Just unable to power off the headphone despite the earbuds are attached together. Its remains on untill it drains its battery. When you put it in charging its again power on automatically.Sound is loud and bass quality is ok enough.,Worst experience,1
This product is very good in this segment.I specially bought if for calls & surprisingly it's the best of all I have ever used. This is my something 10th or 11th pair of earphones. Sound quality is also good in segment.I have managed to get all power of it with some settings.,Best in mid range segment.,4
I am very unhappy with the purchase..as after few days of purchase. I called local service center and they denied to take back with mention of usage damage. While there is not even a scratch mark in it. I am very dissatisfied and all money paid is just lost .,A defective product with one Speaker got damaged before 1 month and no replacement,1

Very worst product it's highly priced. It won't connect automatically. It vibrates when call comes you can't able to disable vibration for this price buy some other good brand. And one thing you can't able to return it. Sound is good but not better,Very worst product,2
When I check box and packing in noise official site is different from Amazon delivered pack. Not sure why but box shouldn't be with white color packing.,Amazon is delivered not genuine product,1
Actually my Bluetooth headset didn't work after 1 and half month. I mailed about the same to the noise company from their website. They booked courier for returning the item and they sent me new product again. It took nearly 9 days but they responded very nicely.,Good product,3
Never  purchase noise its really noise not good quality thing chep products with cheap branding and manufacturing  i use it for 1 houre after that one side of ear bud breaks and when i tried for replacement they rejected asked for return means i don't have any work its completely costumer dis satisfaction . I recommend you to go for other one this company is full waste of money,Full waste of money and time,1
I bought it in noise official website one month back as it is not available on Amazon.It started randomly disconnecting and pairing again I tried resetting it but of no useQuality of software is pathetic from noise brand,Pairing issues after using for one month,1
Using since a week. Sound quality and battery backup seems impressive. But I was expecting the bud size to be smaller. But it takes 3-4 seconds to put in ears. Though I am using the smalles buds available in package.It has a vibrating feature which is annoying whenever the call comes. Vibration magnitude is high.This is my personal experience.,Size of the bud and vibration feature,3
At first I liked it coz the dual mic was working good. But only after 2 months it stopped working even after taking good care. I have a jbl infinity earphone which is much cheaper than this and its quality is premium. Its working absolutely fine ever since I bought it which is more than 3 yrs! Invest in good brands not this cheap one.,Dont buy. Waste of money. Stopped working after 2 months only,1

If in case you are wearing this in gym you are going to have a lot of problem as this device poses every time it comes in contact with your skin and that can really be annoying that touch is really very bad at times and too sensitive sometimes it is not properly connecting with both the devices sometimes it itself turn off and sometimes it is not showing available device to connect cannot properly sync music it sometimes lack to connect,Worst one can’t properly detect touch and not at all compatible with ios,1
"Hello everyone I ordered noise sense Bluetooth @1,099. Just today I got it delivered . After opening the package. Packing was absolutely good and crisp. But once I went inside the  Bluetooth earphone. Looks like it's a refurbished piece or something like that mishandled etc. Bcoz. There is no shine like a new product.  The noise logo on the earbuds are shown very shiny in the pictures silver shine was faded and scratches were there..  also sound quality is also not satisfactory. Bass is good but needs to pin up  treble a Lil bit.  That crystal clear sound is not there ..  better to go with some other than this oneThankyou bie bie",Volume and bass .are not synchronised properly.,3
"That touch response thing instead of the button is a grave mistake by the brand.The touch response is delayed for like 1-2 seconds. So when a call comes instead of accepting the call, you would tap twice and disconnect.The music and videos has it's own trouble. You would be enjoying your music and all of the sudden either it will stop or AI will be triggered. That touch thing works with clothes also.I had the choice to go for one plus buds instead I chose this and regretting ever since.Color also fades with in like a month",Not worth the trouble,3
This was the second time I purchased a product of GoNoise.I was uncertain with Noise Flair so I checked the comparision of Noise Flair with other products which was really helpful.I am glad that I chose Noise Flair.The packing was appropriate.I loved the color of the product which is Forest Green.The sound quality is outstanding.The quality of the neckband is great.Overall I am really satisfied with the product.GoNoise is really a awesome Brand with awesome products and with reasonable price.Thank you Amazon to have the product in your stock as the same was not available on GoNoise Online store.,GoNoise Flair - Amazing Bluetooth Neckband Earphones,5
1. Sound quality is good enough2. Call volume is not enough even my phone call volume is high then its not so high and reachable.3. After earbuds connect each other its disconnect but sometimes its connect when earbuds slowly slide from each other.4. Overall good.. But not as expected.,Good product but not at its best,4
"I have used this product for 1 week now.PROS:best features available at this price range.Long playback time and fast charging(for me, it lasted for 4 days with a single charge of 40 mins).Easy to turn on/off the neckband.Better call quality(better noise handling than Noise Tune Charge).CONS:The touch button gets pressed when listening to music while sleeping, and the voice assistant gets activated.All features like Volume Up/Down and Video forward/backward have been taken care of with just a single button(touch button). This is really confusing.Apart from some dissatisfaction with the touch button, the neckband is perfect and the best one in this price range.",Best One at this price range,4
Bought This in Diwali Sale. Product Quality is Really Good. Using since last month.Sound Quality/Bass/Battery backup is really good as per written on box.Will recommend to buy...Only problem I face is it's touch point if you are sleeping and listening the Music by face touch it is getting stop.Another problem I face is in connectivity it is getting switch on and off by just it's magnetic earbuds so some time if you separate magnetic earbud facing prob to connect to Bluetooth but don't worry just repeat the action of on off it gets connect immediately,Awesome Neckband Ever,4
Overall was a decent earphone but after some months  it's right side buds stopped work. I think this thing donot just happed to me I saw on YouTube there are many facing the same problem...

"Usually in-ear headphones does not gives me comfort and starts paining after a use of small duration. But these are of no match nad give a lot comfort even after a long use.Noise cancellation is good and vaice is very clear and crisp. Touch works as expected and Bluetooth gets connecion is fast and reliable.The only thing I missed is many times I love to hear song on very low volume especially during night time but the low is too high for me.It's been more than a month I bought and the battery backup is excellent, going around 30hrs on single charge.",Good sound and comfort in ears...,5
"What I liked most is the sound quality, 35 hours talk time and 500 hours stand by time, type C charging port. What I did not like is some what low bass, lack of volume control. Magnetic on and off is a good facility to save battery but neck band will not vibrate when ear pieces are stuck together because of magnet. Magnet will naturally connect each other when we wear it on our neck and neck band will be totaly switched off.",Excellent product,5
"Paisa wasool. I had a choice between one plus and these, and I'm glad I chose noise. Sound quality in general is just as good as one plus (I tried my friend's bass edition bulletz), but the design is much better than those. Also, the battery is insane. I am a super heavy user, and I have only had to charged these once a week and I listen at 80% volume. Also, it gets charged in 50 minutes from 0 to 100, which is a bit more than promised, but that's acceptable. Also the dual device connectivity is seamless, and the vibrating call feedback is something I'll look for in all my upcoming earphones. Overall, go for it. It's most likely the best product in the price range.",Brilliant.,5
"I own one already, a Mist Grey, I bought this one as a gift.I loved how swiftly is connected and the part of Touch works is more than just fascinating, also owning ""India's first touch controlled neckband"" I'm wearing it with pride.I love the vibration which was included, Although if I had anything to suggest the Company for Improvements is, control of Volume over the band. Overall it's a Priority Favourite.",It's one Sensational device,5
"The product received originally worked perfectly for 1 month and then suddenly went dead. The noise replaced it with another unit after going through their process.

But when I saw this one, with its features, battery life and quality, I didn't think much and ordered it. And believe me, I have, indeed, made a right decision.

Thanks Noise & Amazon for making a pleasant & happy experience. 😀😀👍👍",Awesome neckband,5
The volume went low within 8 days of usage. Return time on amazon is over. Sent it back to Noise and they sent it back without any repair. Below 50% the volume goes mute. No quality check.Don't waste your money.,Waste of money,1

This is a awesome product which you can buy closing your eyes (and also by paying😅). The quality of this product is 🔥 and in the photo you can't see the shining of silicon but in real it's awesome. And also claiming and registering warranty is too easy for this product. The touch controls are too good. There's no issue with the connectivity and can be used for long ranges(approx 2-5m) battery life is also awesome. And also the on and off feature is great and also the dual paring option.The only con's about this product is that it doesn't come with strong magnets.And I am not a paid advertiser for giving good reviews. I am also a customer who bought it and loved the product.,Value for money and too good product,5

"Till now have great experience with noise flair headphones. It's good looking, power saving. Only problem I face with this is it doesn't have volume button.

Neck bank sounded well but the charging stopped working after first cycle. I am running after support for fixing the issue and it took almost 2 weeks now.Support has been worst. They are not blthered about customers. Please don't buy,Issues with charging,1
Earlier I was using Onle pluse earphone.I bought this one its worst.1. Voice cancelation is for no use. Receiver will hear more voice of surrounding than caller's voice.2. Worst sensor touch.3. There is no button for volume control.4. Very delicate... like 100rs earphone.5. Battery is very nice.6. There is no service centre.Pay 100 rs more and go for best earphone in this price range or pay only 100 rs at station and get better earphone than Noise flair Bluetooth.,Worst earphone... onplus is 100 times better. I've used both,1
Everything is good about this product except lack of dedicated power button and switching off when buds are held together ....call vibration facility becomes unusable (which is one of the reason I bought this ),"Good product, will 4.5 overall",4
"These are the worst Neckband, first of all there is a big latency issue, they start with a disturbance and skip the sound for first 2 seconds, lastly the build quality is the worst and they officials won't even approve a warranty claim if something happens to the neckband physically because they even know that it has a poor build quality. Don't buy it.","The worst quality, the worst Service, no warranty claims",1

Very bad product....... noise cancellation during call is very verse...... opposite side person hears only traffic sound...... Totally waste of money for this product,Useless,1
"Quality as per the price is great... I got for 1099...battery is not as expected  but I get easily 10-15 hour of use.  At full volume... But they recommend to use at 70% volume level to get 25 hrs of battery life... Bass is high, so good for high bass user not good for people who like use treble more...

"not buy, my opinion",After 15 days ....right side sound not properly working,1
The product is ok can’t say good… reason is because the touch to receive the call is not that good and if the touch button touches the shoulder it quickly mutes the audio. The product is average. But if compared to others the Battry life and the sound quality is good enough. For the deal I got on this is ok for the product. I got a good discount that’s satisfactory. The magnet is also not that strong a slight pull departs the buds.,The magnet is not that powerful. Also the touch to receive the call is not prompt.,3
